                <strong class="strong">Summary:</strong>Harry Potter has no idea how 
                famous he is. That's because he's being raised by his miserable aunt 
                and uncle who are terrified Harry will learn that he's really a wizard, 
                just as his parents were. But everything changes when Harry is summoned 
                to attend an infamous school for wizards, and he begins to discover some 
                clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is 
                greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful faculty 
                at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical 
                world he never knew existed and closer to his own noble destiny.
